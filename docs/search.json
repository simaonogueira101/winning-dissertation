Da mesma forma que investigação continua discordar sobre suas definições conceptuais e tipológicas, o impacto e estrutura ideal das aceleradoras permanecem pouco claros. Esta dissertação visa transpor um estudo realizado ecossistema dos EUA para realidade Europeia através da utilização de dados e estatística, ao analisar relações entre variáveis que compõem os programas de aceleração e o sucesso - ou falta dele - das startups que os completam. Os dados foram recolhidos através de uma série de agregadores, notícias e websites, e inseridos em modelos de regressão linear fim de testar hipótese de que estrutura de uma aceleradora tem impacto na probabilidade de sucesso das suas startups. Os nossos resultados reflectem os efeitos positivos de uma grande e diversificada rede de parceiros, patrocinadores, fundadores e empresas, mas tiveram dificuldade em explicar na íntegra os mecanismos por detrás sucesso da aceleração. Os nossos dados permitiram distinguir entre aceleradoras mal e bem concebidas, estabelecendo que o impacto das segundas é mais forte tanto curto quanto longo prazo, dando lugar à proposta de uma estrutura para uma aceleradora que maximiza hipóteses de sucesso das startups.","code":""},{"path":"introduction.html","id":"introduction","chapter":"1 Introduction","heading":"1 Introduction","text":"","code":""},{"path":"introduction.html","id":"the-european-ecosystem-its-startups-and-accelerators","chapter":"1 Introduction","heading":"1.1 The European Ecosystem, Its Startups, and Accelerators","text":"Startups fail - lot. many 9 every 10 accomplish goals set achieve (Nobel 2011).
